## Briefly about myself:
During my bachelor degree study I`ve spent a lot of time creating mobile applications and learning Java and Android. This experience led me to ITMO where I met new friends interested in frontend development and therefore I became passionate about it as well.

I had began self-studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript this winter and by the May I was invited in the freelance team who worked on frontend part for e-commerce projects. I have proved myself to be a non-conflict, responsible team player and have improved my skills a lot, working with SASS, Pug and Vue.

Speaking about my weakness I can admit that I am not capable of learning very fast. In spite of this I believe that my strenghts will help me master new skills and become a proficient frontend developer.

## Code example:

**Task from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55f8a9c06c018a0d6e000132)**
> *ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits. If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.*

**My solution:**
```
function validatePIN (pin) {
    let nums = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0']
    let pinDigits = pin.toString().split('').map(s => {
        if (nums.includes(s)) {return 1}
        else {return 0}
    })
  if (!pinDigits.includes(0)) {
    if (pinDigits.length == 4 || pinDigits.length == 6) {
      return true
    } else { return false}
  }
  else {return false}
}
```
